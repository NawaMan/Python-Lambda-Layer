# Python-Lambda-Layer
An AWS application to create a proper Python Lambda Layer.

Python-Lambda-Layer is an AWS application that allows users to create a well-structured Python Lambda Layer.
This application simplifies the process of creating and managing Lambda Layers in AWS, making it easier for users to package their Python libraries and dependencies.
Particularly those who has no access to proper environment needed to create compatible laters (Python 3.9 on Linux).

With Python-Lambda-Layer, users can easily create a Layer that can be shared across multiple AWS Lambda functions.
This makes it possible to reuse the same code across different functions, which saves time and reduces the risk of errors.
The application is user-friendly and provides a straightforward interface that simplifies the entire process of creating and managing Lambda Layers.
